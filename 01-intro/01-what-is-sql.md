# What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data efficiently. SQL is used by data analysts, developers, and database administrators to interact with data stored in tables.

## Key Features
- **Declarative Language:** You specify *what* you want, not *how* to get it.
- **Standardized:** ANSI SQL is supported by most relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.).
- **Powerful:** Can handle simple lookups to complex analytical queries.

## Why Learn SQL?
- Essential for working with data in almost any industry
- Required for backend development, data analysis, and business intelligence
- Used in interviews and real-world projects

## Example Use Cases
- Querying sales data for reports
- Updating user information in an app
- Analyzing website traffic

## Basic SQL Example
```sql
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE created_at > '2026-01-01';
```
This query retrieves the names and emails of users who joined after January 1, 2026.
