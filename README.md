# SQL Fundamentals

A structured, example-driven documentation repository covering **core SQL concepts**,
real-world query patterns, and essential performance considerations.

This repository is designed to be **clear, progressive, and practical**, not a collection
of random SQL notes.

## Why This Repository Exists

Many SQL resources either:

- Focus only on syntax without real-world context, or
- Jump into advanced topics without building strong fundamentals

This repository focuses on:

- Clear explanations
- Practical, realistic examples
- Production-aware thinking

It is suitable for **learning, revision, and interview preparation**.

## What This Repository Covers

- SQL fundamentals (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, DISTINCT, NULL handling)
- Filtering and conditional logic
- Table joins and relational concepts
- Aggregation and grouping
- Subqueries and EXISTS
- Indexing basics
- Transactions and isolation levels
- Query optimization and common anti-patterns
- Real-world example schemas and queries

All examples follow **ANSI SQL**, with notes where database behavior differs.

### If You Are Preparing for Interviews

---

Focus on:

- JOIN behavior and edge cases
- GROUP BY vs HAVING
- EXISTS vs IN
- Index usage and misuse
- Query performance anti-patterns

## Documentation Format

Each topic follows a consistent structure:

- What the concept is
- Syntax
- Real-world examples
- When to use it
- Common mistakes
- Performance notes

This consistency makes the repository easy to scan, revise, and reference.

## Databases

Examples are written using **standard SQL**.

Where relevant, differences are noted for:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite

Database-specific syntax is avoided unless clearly explained.

## Design Philosophy

- Prefer **clarity over cleverness**
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Emphasize patterns used in real applications
- Treat performance as a first-class concern

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome.

Please ensure that:

- File naming and numbering conventions are followed
- Examples are realistic and practical
- Database-specific behavior is clearly labeled
- Documentation remains concise and accurate
